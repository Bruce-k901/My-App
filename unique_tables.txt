POTENTIAL MISMATCHES TO CHECK:
==============================
1. ppm_schedule (in PPMDrawer.tsx, ppm.ts) - should be ppm_schedules
2. incident_reports vs incidents - check if both exist
3. global_documents vs global_docs - check consistency
4. maintenance_logs - verify table exists
5. breakdowns - verify table exists
6. policies, risk_assessments, coshh_register - verify these exist
7. asset_uptime_report - verify this exists
8. ppm_history - verify this exists
