/**
 * Modular Template Feature Components
 * 
 * Each feature is a self-contained component that handles its own:
 * - UI rendering
 * - State management
 * - Integration with other features (e.g., monitor/callout)
 * - Pre-population from template data
 * 
 * Features are dynamically rendered based on template configuration.
