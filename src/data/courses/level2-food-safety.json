For the Business\n- **Legal Action**: Unlimited fines and potential closure orders.\n- **Reputation**: Loss of customer trust and negative reviews.\n- **Staff**: Low morale and high turnover.\n\n### 2. For the Customer\n- **Illness**: Food poisoning can cause serious health issues, especially for vulnerable groups.\n- **Fatalities**: In severe cases (e.g., allergens), negligence can be fatal.",

Deny Food:\n- **Store properly**: All food in sealed, pest-proof containers\n- **Clean thoroughly**: Remove crumbs and spills immediately\n- **Waste management**: Lidded bins, emptied regularly\n- **No feeding**: Never leave pet food out\n\n### 3. Deny Shelter:\n- **Declutter**: Remove cardboard boxes and packaging\n- **Clean behind equipment**: Regular deep cleaning\n- **Maintain grounds**: Keep outdoor areas tidy\n- **Fix leaks**: Eliminate water sources\n\n**Remember**: Prevention is cheaper and easier than treatment!",
