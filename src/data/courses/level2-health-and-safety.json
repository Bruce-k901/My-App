Is there space?\n\n### Safe Lifting Technique:\n1. **Feet**: Apart, one leg forward.\n2. **Knees**: Bend them (not your back!).\n3. **Back**: Keep it straight.\n4. **Grip**: Hug the load close to your body.\n5. **Head**: Look forward.",

Fuel\nSomething to burn. In a kitchen, this could be:\n- Cooking oil or fat.\n- Cardboard boxes or packaging.\n- Gas supply.\n\n### 2. Oxygen\nFire needs air to breathe. Sources include:\n- Natural airflow (windows/doors).\n- Ventilation systems.\n\n### 3. Heat\nSomething to start the fire. Sources include:\n- Deep fat fryers.\n- Ovens and hobs.\n- Faulty electrical equipment.\n\n### How to Stop Fire\n- **Starvation**: Remove the **Fuel** (e.g., turn off the gas).\n- **Smothering**: Remove the **Oxygen** (e.g., use a fire blanket on a pan).\n- **Cooling**: Remove the **Heat** (e.g., use water on a paper fire - NEVER on oil!).",
