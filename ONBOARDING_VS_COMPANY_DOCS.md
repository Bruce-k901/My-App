# 📂 Document System Overview

## Two Separate Document Libraries

Your document system now has **two distinct purposes**:

---

## 1️⃣ Onboarding Documents (Employee-Specific)

**Location:** People > Onboarding > Docs

**Purpose:** Documents that new employees receive when they join

**Categories:**
- `Onboarding - Contracts` (4 employment contracts)
- `Onboarding - Policies` (Staff Handbook)
- `Onboarding - Forms` (New Starter Form, Uniform, Right to Work, etc.)

**Use For:**
- ✅ Employment contracts (FOH/BOH × Hourly/Salaried)
- ✅ Staff handbook
- ✅ New starter forms
- ✅ Employee onboarding paperwork
- ✅ Training acknowledgments

**How It Works:**
1. Create starter kit (13 placeholder documents)
2. Upload your versions
3. Documents auto-assign to onboarding packs
4. Employees receive their pack when hired

## Why The Separation?

### Onboarding Documents
- **Employee-specific** - Each new hire gets a personalized pack
- **Role-based** - Different packs for FOH/BOH, Hourly/Salaried
- **Tracked** - Monitor which employees have acknowledged each document
- **Templated** - Same documents for all new starters

### Company Documents
- **Company-wide** - Not tied to individual employees
- **Reference** - Available for audits, inspections, day-to-day operations
- **Compliance** - Legal requirements, certifications, policies
- **Versioned** - Keep historical versions for audit trails

---

## Example Workflow

### Hiring a New FOH Server (Hourly)

**Step 1: Onboarding Documents**

2. Assign "FOH - Hourly Staff" onboarding pack
3. Employee receives 10 documents:

   - New Starter Details Form
   - Uniform Issued Record
   - Wage Deduction Authorisation
   - Right to Work Verification

- ✅ **Company docs** use traditional categories
- ✅ Different pages for different purposes
