    "body": "UK food law is built around the Food Safety Act 1990 and the Food Hygiene Regulations 2006. They exist to protect guests from illness and to keep businesses trading.\n\nRegulators expect everyone on shift to understand the basics: keep food safe, record what you do, and raise issues quickly. That duty applies whether you prep, cook, serve, or supervise.",

When inspectors visit they look at behaviour and records to judge compliance.",
