- ✅ Assign them in **Settings → Areas & Regions**
- ✅ They'll appear in appropriate sections automatically

### 4. **For Site Managers**

3. Select the manager from the dropdown

**A**: Generally no. Leave site blank for:

Only assign a site if they work primarily at one location.

1. Save the changes
