### 3. **Maintenance Hardware Kit** - Three Tiers (one-time hardware)

**What it is:** Small physical tags (QR, NFC, or both) stuck onto every asset. Acts as the "identity badge" for fridges, mixers, ovens, dishwashers, extractors, etc. Staff scan with Checkly app to instantly access PPM schedules, fault history, callouts, instruction sheets, warranty details, serial numbers, suppliers, contractors, and sensor feeds.

**What the tags do:**

1. **Fault Reporting** - Staff scan, pick fault type, upload photos/notes, immediately creates callout
2. **PPM Check-in** - Contractor scans on arrival, logs visit, signs off tasks, auto-populates PPM log
3. **Daily Checks** - Kitchen team scans for asset-specific checks (temps, visual, filters, cleaning)
4. **Asset History** - Every scan opens timeline: install date, repairs, photos, notes, costs, supplier performance, warranty claims

**Why it works:** Kitchens are chaotic. People don't remember serial numbers. Nobody knows who last fixed the dishwasher. Paperwork goes missing. Scanning the tag solves all of that.

#### **Tier 1 - Basic: £35/site (one-time)**

- QR tags only
- Setup guide
- Contractor scan instructions
- Replacement tag pack
- **Hardware cost:** £0.05-£0.20 per tag (printed stickers or durable plastic)

#### **Tier 2 - Pro: £75/site (one-time)** ⭐ Most Popular

- QR + NFC tags
- Waterproof fridge-safe variants
- Better durability
- Faster contractor check-ins (tap with phone)

#### **Tier 3 - Observatory: £125-£150/site (one-time)**

- Laser-etched metal tags
- Premium branding
- Multi-site pack bundles
- Replacement tags free for life
- **Hardware cost:** Higher but still pennies compared to price

**Commercial angle:** Pure margin because hardware costs are pennies. You're selling the ecosystem, not the sticker. Ties clients deeper into Checkly because everything is now physically linked.
