# Module 8 · FSMS, Records, Inspections

## HACCP in action

- Identify critical control points (CCPs) in your recipes
- Set limits (e.g. cooking temperature) and monitor each service
- Record results and corrective actions when something drifts out of spec

## Record keeping

- Training: keep certificates and expiry dates in the Training Matrix
- Monitoring: log temperatures, cleaning checks, maintenance fixes
- Incidents: document allergen near-misses, complaints, pest activity

## Inspection readiness

- Keep evidence filed and easy to reach—digital or paper is fine if organised
- Brief the team to answer questions confidently and honestly
- Walk the site weekly as an inspector would; fix issues before they visit

## Pre-inspection checklist

- [ ] Update the “front-of-house” board with your latest food hygiene rating
- [ ] Confirm all CCP records are present for the last 4 weeks
- [ ] Run a mock inspection and capture any improvements needed
