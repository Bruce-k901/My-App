# Module 5 · Temperature Control and Storage

## Critical temperatures

- **Cooking**: 75°C core (or 70°C for 2 minutes)
- **Hot holding**: 63°C minimum
- **Chilling**: 0–5°C for high-risk foods
- **Freezing**: -18°C or below

## Cooling safely

1. Portion into shallow trays to drop heat quickly
2. Use blast chillers or ice baths where available
3. Record cooling times: 90 minutes to 21°C, then 4 hours to 5°C

## Storage order

- Top shelves: ready-to-eat foods
- Middle: cooked meats, dairy
- Bottom: raw meats in leak-proof containers
- Door: condiments, low-risk items

## Daily controls

- [ ] Check and log fridge/freezer temperatures at least twice a day
- [ ] Probe foods before service and record corrective actions
- [ ] Discard any foods left cooling for too long or without records
