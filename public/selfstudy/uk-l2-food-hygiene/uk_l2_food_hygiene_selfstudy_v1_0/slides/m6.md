# Module 6 · Cleaning, Waste, Pests

## Two-stage cleaning

1. **Clean**: remove debris with detergent and hot water
2. **Disinfect**: apply food-safe disinfectant, allow full contact time

- Air dry or use paper towels; never re-use cloths between stages

## Waste management

- Empty bins before they are full; seal bags immediately
- Keep external waste areas clean, closed and pest-proof
- Record deep cleans of waste stores and wheelie bins

## Pest vigilance

- Look for droppings, gnawed packaging, smear marks, dead insects
- Report sightings in the pest log and take the affected area out of use
- Work with your contractor on routine visits and follow-up actions

## Shift routine

- [ ] Complete open/close cleaning checklists and sign off
- [ ] Sanitise high-touch surfaces every 4 hours or between tasks
- [ ] Inspect internal and external waste areas for spills or pests
