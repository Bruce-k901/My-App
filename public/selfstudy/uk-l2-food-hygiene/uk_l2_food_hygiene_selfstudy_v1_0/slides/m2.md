# Module 2 · Food Hazards

## Hazard groups

- **Biological**: bacteria (Salmonella, Listeria), viruses, moulds
- **Chemical**: cleaning agents, pesticides, taints
- **Physical**: glass, metal, jewellery, packaging

## Spotting risks early

- Walk the kitchen before each service: look, listen, smell
- Check deliveries for damage, poor temperature control or pests
- Keep raw and ready-to-eat foods apart at every stage

## Control priorities

1. Prevent the hazard from entering the food environment
2. Remove or reduce the hazard through controls (cooking, cleaning, segregation)
3. Monitor and record that the control stayed effective

## Apply it now

- [ ] Inspect today’s deliveries for damage or temperature abuse
- [ ] Remove any cracked or worn utensils from service
- [ ] Re-brief staff on the colour-coded chopping board system
